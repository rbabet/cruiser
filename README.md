This is a program for generating a solid simple science-based training plan. The target is strength and some growth.
The purpose of this program is to practice creating and publishing a personal Python project. Nothing more.
It is an application version of the 'Cruiser' training plan by Fabio Zonin of StrongFirst. All credit for the plan is his.

Before running the Python program, choose four drills (exercises): squat, press, pull, and hinge. 
The movements can be fast or slow. 
They can be kettlebell, barbell, bodyweight, or any combination you like.
Test each drill. Find your 8-12RM, i.e. the load or progression that lets you do between 8 and 12 perfect reps. 

When running the program, you will be prompted to enter the RMs for each drill if there is no saved data. 
You can opt to delete the saved data and re-enter it. It's good to retest every 8 weeks or when things seem too easy.

The program will do virtual die rolling and determine the weekly NL for each drill and per session.
The week's sessions will be displayed. Alternate sets of each pair of drills until all reps are done.
